                        <p>Hardware Computer hardware consists of the physical electronic and mechanical elements of a computersystem. [1] It refers to the physical elements of an analog or digital computer system. This term differentiates the tangible parts of a computer from software, which comprises coded, machine-readable instructions or programs that guide the hardware on how and when to perform specific tasks.

                            Internal hardware components are the crucial elements that constitute the core of a computer system. These components include the central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), hard disk drives (HDD), and motherboard.

                        <p>
                            The computer casing serves as the enclosure for all of a PC's internal components. Typically constructed from steel to ensure durability, these cases tend to be somewhat bulky. This makes them ideal for enthusiasts, as they provide ample space to work within and make it easier to access and replace parts. In contrast, laptops are more challenging to work on due to their compact, enclosed design.

                        <p>
                            The motherboard is a printed circuit board that contains most or all of the computer's internal components. These include the central processor (CPU), memory modules, and expansion cards such as sound, graphics, and video cards. It also houses ports like USB 2.0, Firewire, and DVI, which connect peripherals, including the monitor.
