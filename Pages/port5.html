                            Motherboards function as the central circuit board within a computer, enabling essential input/output operations, power
                            distribution, and data communication among all hardware components. By integrating slots, sockets, and connectors, they offer users the
                            flexibility to customize and enhance their systems, facilitating hardware upgrades to optimize computing processes and speed. Over time,
                            motherboards have evolved through various iterations to accommodate different computing needs, with each iteration tailored for specific
                            compatibility and performance requirements.

                            Motherboards serve as the main printed circuit board (PCB) in a computer, acting as the backbone that connects and facilitates
                            communication among key components, including the CPU, RAM, storage devices, and peripherals. By distributing power and enabling data
                            exchange, motherboards allow for seamless communication between various input/output devices and interfaces. Modern motherboards are
                            equipped with a variety of slots and connectors to enhance their functionality. For example, PCIe slots accommodate expansion cards such as
                            graphics and network cards, while SATA ports connect to storage devices like SSDs and HDDs. Memory slots hold RAM modules and typically
                            support dual or quad-channel configurations, and the CPU socket connects to the processor, determining compatibility with specific CPUs.
                            Additionally, I/O ports on the back panel provide connectivity for USB devices, audio jacks, and Ethernet, ensuring comprehensive system
                            interaction and functionality.

                            AT motherboards were widely used in personal computers during the 1980s, with "AT" standing for Advanced Technology. These
                            motherboards had a distinct size and shape, fitting exclusively into AT computer cases and measuring 305 mm by 280 mm. They featured a large
                            power connector and several expansion slots located along the bottom edge. The processor, or "brain" of the computer, was positioned in the top
                            right corner, with memory slots situated nearby. AT motherboards relied on the ISA (Industry Standard Architecture) system for adding new
                            hardware components. Compared to modern motherboards, they offered fewer connectors and ports, making them relatively simpler in design

                            ATX motherboards are the modern type used in most contemporary computers, with "ATX" standing for Advanced Technology Extended.
                            They are an improved version of the older AT motherboards and feature a standardized size and layout, measuring 305 mm by 244 mm. The power
                            connector is located at the top of the board, while expansion slots for additional components are positioned along the bottom, offering more space
                            between components. The processor is placed centrally, with memory slots situated to its right. One key improvement of ATX motherboards is
                            enhanced power management, allowing users to turn the computer on and off through the operating system, making them more convenient than
                            earlier designs.

                            AT and ATX are two types of motherboards used in computers, with AT standing for Advanced Technology and ATX for Advanced
                            Technology Extended. These motherboard types differ in size, layout, and features. AT motherboards are older and simpler, whereas ATX boards
                            are newer and more advanced. Key distinctions include their shape, component connections, and functionality. ATX motherboards introduced
                            improvements that enhanced computer performance and usability.

                            Extended ATX (EATX) is the largest variant of ATX motherboards, designed for building high-performance PC systems. Its size makes it
                            compatible with full tower cases, providing plenty of space and features. The larger footprint not only allows for more expansion options but also
                            gives components ample room for better airflow, which aids in overclocking and boosts overall performance. EATX motherboards are ideal for avid
                            gamers or professionals in fields like graphic design and video editing. However, these benefits come with a high price tag.

                            Micro ATX is a more compact motherboard form factor that provides a smaller alternative to the larger ATX. While it has fewer expansion
                            slots and components, it remains a good option for budget builds, HTPCs, and compact desktops. Its smaller size makes it more energy-efficient
                            and ideal for low-power systems, though it may not perform as well in high-end builds. Micro ATX typically supports two RAM slots, compared to
                            four on ATX boards, and is more affordable. However, it has limited space for components and cooling solutions, with smaller heatsinks and fewer
                            fan headers, which can hinder its performance in powerful setups. Additionally, its smaller I/O shield can restrict the number of available ports
                            and connectors.

                            M-ATX is a more compact version of the ATX, typically measuring 244 x 244 mm, and supports the same processors, graphics cards, and
                            four RAM slots as ATX boards, but with fewer expansion options to save space. Most M-ATX boards have a maximum of two PCIExpress x16 slots,
                            making it difficult to fit dual graphics cards, and they also offer fewer PCIExpress x4 and x1 slots, USB and SATA connectors, and M.2 drive
                            mounts. While M-ATX motherboards used to include more onboard connectors than ATX boards, by 2020, both offer similar core features, with
                            M-ATX having slightly fewer connection options. M-ATX is backward compatible with ATX cases, which is useful for upgrades, but using an ATX
                            case with an M-ATX motherboard diminishes the space-saving benefits and limits the advantages of a larger ATX feature set.

                            LPX (Low Profile eXtension) is a motherboard form factor developed by Western Digital in 1987, primarily used in the late 1980s and
                            1990s. It measures 9" wide by 13" deep and features a riser card, with a unique layout for the video, parallel, serial, and PS/2 ports compared to
                            other motherboard designs of the time. The key feature of LPX is that expansion boards are inserted into a riser with multiple slots, positioning the
                            boards parallel to the motherboard instead of perpendicular, as seen in other form factors like AT and ATX. This design allows for smaller
                            computer cases, although it typically limits the number of expansion boards to two or three.

                        <p>
                            BTX, or Balanced Technology eXtended, is a motherboard form factor introduced by Intel in 2004 as a replacement for the ATX standard.
                            It was developed to address key issues in the ATX design, particularly problems with heat. The ATX layout restricted airflow, leading to inadequate
                            cooling, whereas BTX redesigned the placement of components like the processor and northbridge chip to improve airflow and enhance cooling
                            performance. Despite these advantages, BTX did not gain widespread popularity due to several factors: many users were already invested in ATX
                            systems, BTX boards were more expensive, and most people didn't prioritize cooling. Additionally, Intel has discontinued development of BTX,
                            further diminishing its appeal.
