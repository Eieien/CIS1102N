                        <p>The world of computing is very broad, especially when it comes to applying this into both society and our lives. A lot of concepts and topics have to be understood in order to pursue a specific discipline. Before I entered college, I already had a background in programming and some concepts, however I did not know exactly what each course focused on and what is needed to learn from them. So when I researched about what each discipline is, I was interested in what they were focusing on, especially software engineering since most of the skills in computer science will be useful there and it's also applicable with the other 4 disciplines. 

                            Although the software engineering discipline intrigued me the most. The other 4 disciplines are also interesting to me. Computer Engineering, which was my second option in college, being able to both develop and apply software and hardware systems but needs a general understanding on the systems architecture feels like a huge headache but looks fun. Since it focuses on embedded coding like robotics or plainly computers, it has a huge scope to learn but very expensive to take considering the components

                            My initial thoughts on Information systems, technology and computer science was that they are all the same. However during my analysis and research from this portfolio was that they focus on different aspects while implementing in an organization. IS is essential to an organization as they provide the relevant and necessary information using technology that is needed for a company to fully analyze their problems and grow. Whilst IT is essential for implementing the technology of both hardware and software systems for the organization to operate efficiently. I found out that both IT and IS are mostly application technologies just with different directions and disciplines.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But my thoughts for computer science were far from what I originally thought. my impressions was that it focuses on application of technology based from my sister in college but it mostly focuses on using theories, mathematical formulas, and my favorite, algorithms! Computer science was my first choice and I find it really fun to learn these kinds of things. Since computer science focuses heavily on theoretical concepts of programming, it looks fun to learn, analyze, and execute my skills and hopefully improve on it. And most of all, computer science can branch out to IT and IS and SE since its CS was one of the first computing disciplines along with computer engineering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In conclusion, all of the computing disciplines may focus on certain aspects in technology and will be useful for organizations that are in the evolving world where we are today. All of them are interesting in my opinion and are connected to each other with similar skills to learn. My perspective on the different courses were widened and hopefully I can learn more about them in this subject along with the other topics in ITC.

                            From what I researched, I managed to understand more about the importance of information systems and its significance to many organizations and business there is. Gathering data and turning it into information is very important to study as it is essential for a company to grow by improving certain systems and softwares that will be needed to be maintained and observed. Information is a crucial part not just for companies but for our lives as it tells us what we need to know and to improve on which is what I understood the most from the topics I researched. It was further expanded through the topic of information systems. What I found about information systems is that they are very interesting especially for data science, It may seem complicated and complex but most of them are very important to learn when building databases and  transaction services. Information systems also helps the google search lists as well which is nice and handy. I do hope I can learn someday about making an information system. Furthermore, the types of information systems are very interesting to me as it helps me identify the different roles or areas that an information system would need. Simply, it cannot be done by one person since it is too complicated and a lot of thinking has to be done before making a move with such information which is why roles are needed. The roles is equally divided like a hierarchy or a pyramid to control and oversee what is needed to be done or processed. It helps me understand that there should be a lot of process and thinking from human resources alone and not mostly to rely on the Information that was given from the system. Since I am mostly solo on works, it helps me think carefully when messing with information and hopefully I can brainstorm a lot of ideas just from this information alone.

                            Looking into number systems gives me an insight of how machine code usually runs from them, despite us as human who use the decimal numbering system in our daily lives, we could see that it could be abstracted or simplified further to modify or learn machine learning or making computers. This topic has given me a little insight as well on how numbering systems would affect or run the computer architecture and its relationship with the hardware, firmware, and software areas. In a human computer interaction, it is interesting and complicated to simplify/abstract the different kinds of number system since we have no visual perspective in knowing how these instructions run so smoothly in our devices even though we use it in our daily lives. My reaction to this topic even though it was tiring to research the sources was that it really is intriguing to know that most of our technology runs on these numbering systems. The hexadecimal numbering system is the most obvious system to see since its mainly used for web development in CSS and colors for our computer, it is also highly used for simplifying the binary instructions that runs our computer which i think that it makes our computer run more smoother I guess so, I don’t know these are just thoughts from this portfolio. Furthermore, I didn’t really know that decimal number system is used in our day to day lives even though we use it everyday so I never really bothered thinking about it since its math. Throughout my entire research of this portfolio, I learned a lot and it really inspired me to try machine learning one day (Hopefully I won’t break my laptop) since its interesting but as well to go deeper in the topic of binary systems since its really fun and interesting for me.

                        The implementations of hardware and software is very broad, especially when there are so many fields out there that are using these innovations. Throughout this research and in creating this portfolio, I have so much to learn about how to implement these concepts into my daily life, and I am truly excited to learn more about software and hardware architecture. Basing from the concepts itself might be a fun way to explore more about how a computer actually work and how machine code usually operates along with the systems software. I was also interested in learning more about the architecture of the computer here but I think mostly I researched about the basic parts of the computer since I wasn’t able to find much journals but overall I am still interested. I like how both software and hardware could be broad in many ways but it also could be adapted for a certain field like how we could upgrade and automate businesses and education. It’s very interesting for me to think what can i build from these concept alone and to actually expand my knowledge and learn more about what I want to create in the nearby future as a software engineer. Hopefully as well, I can tackle other concepts and expand my knowledge on them but for now I’ll start small with the hardware and software but eventually go up to the hard parts. From my point of view, as I say it again, it is very broad for me since technology is still evolving and we still have to keep up with it if we don’t wanna lost ourselves in this competition of technology especially when getting a job since it might hard. but either way I would to delve more deeper in this topic like the architecture and stuff but unfortunately im running out of time to pass. But this topic is very interesting and I would hope to learn more about it.
